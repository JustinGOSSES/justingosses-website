Justin lives in Houston, Texas with my wife and dog Momo. 

## Interests include:
- Things that could exist but don't yet.
- Water based things like kayaking, surfing, paddle boarding, and little web-based services that help me decide when and where to go.
- Things at the intersection of geology & code.
- Open source geospatial tools
- Natural Language Processing
- Sharing at Scale:
    - This includes questions like open data interface design; code citation tooling as a way to change its perceived value; group membership and behaviors in open source that impact how science gets done; different incentives between inner source and open source; platform and tooling effects on code sharing; and code dependencies as reusable metadata and a metaphor for developer skills.

## Professional History
I have been a Program Manager, Data Scientist, Software Developer, and Geoscientist.

Currently, I work at Microsoft as a Senior Program Manager focused on improving the <a href='https://innersourcecommons.org/'>inner source</a> experience, or use and reuse of code across organizational boundaries. 

I previously worked as a NASA contractor, supporting NASA’s Office of the Chief Information Officer’s Transformation & Data division in two roles.

(1.)  As Principal Data Scientist data analytics team, I worked on projects that leverage modern data science, data visualization, and machine-learning approaches to solve client problems and help speed adoption of the latest tools. In the earliest form of the role, I focused on providing advise, consulting, and prototypes for internal NASA customers in finance, human resources, facilities, space technology, and other domains. Later on, I worked on enterprise level processes and tooling for data warehousing, data analytics, data catalogs, and metadata standards. I’ve done machine-learning projects in NLP (natural language processing), automated speech recognition, image recognition, as well as with tabular data in different forms.

(2.) I was also the technical program manager for Open-Innovation program, responsible for sharing NASA’s open data and open source code through the public facing websites data.nasa.gov, code.nasa.gov, api.nasa.gov, github.com/nasa as well as the programs and infrastructure to support internal-facing inner source activities.

Before NASA, I worked as a geoscientist for BP and got to dig into data to answer questions that drove business questions across Canada, U.S., and Brazil. Towards the end of my time there I also got to use code to build solutions that domain specific software applications couldn't be twisted into answering via graphics user interfaces alone.
