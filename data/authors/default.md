Justin Gosses has been a Program Manager, Data Scientist, Software Developer, and Geoscientist.

Justin lives in Houston, Texas with his wife and dog Momo. Friends, good food at all the price points, and easy access to shallow water for kayaking and paddle boarding keep him there.

Interests include:
- Things that could exist but don't yet.
- Things at the intersection of geology & code.
- Little web-based services that help make decisions for water-based outdoor activities. 
- Open source geospatial tools
- Natural Language Processing
- Sharing at Scale:
    - This includes questions like comparing different benefits and costs of open data catalogs, APIs, and dashboards; code citation tooling as a way to change its cultural value; group membership and behaviors in open source that impact how science is done; different incentives and participation drivers between inner source and open source; platform and tooling effects on code sharing; and code dependencies as reusable metadata and a metaphor for developer skills.
