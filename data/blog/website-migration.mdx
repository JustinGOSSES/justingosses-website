## Overview

A post describing my experience moving this website from WordPress to Next.js & TailwindCSS.

<TOCInline toc={props.toc} exclude="Overview" toHeading={2} />


## History
I originally got the domain for justingosses.com and set up a website in early 2015. 
At the time, I wanted a place to establish a bit of online identity specific to code and separate from my resume.

I picked WordPress as my front-end web development skills were still developing and WordPress's ecosystem of plugins
 meant I wouldn't be slowed at my skills at the time in case I wanted to do something complicated or non-static.
 In retospect, I would have been able to use a static site generator, but I wasn't certain about it at the time.

The site has never gotten super complicated. It's just a blog, side projects, contact page, etc. 
I've added some custom JavaScript and hacked on an existing theme and server side PHP code a little. 
Everythig can be replicated with a static website that is front-end only.

## Reasons to Change
The big drivers for me to finally move away from WordPress were:
- Cost
- Don't Really Need a Server
- Easier to try new things if content is in markdown

#### Cost
I originally bought the domain and set up the website through a company that specializes in hosting WordPress pages. 
Like many similar services, they're very cheap the first year and then raise the price going forward. 
The cost raises were annoying, which eventually led to me to migrate the WordPress site to AWS and their EC2 service.
Unfortunately, after several months on there, I figured out the cost savings on there weren't as much as I had hoped.
It was still less, but not meeting expectations.

#### Don't Really Need a Server
Additionally, it had long been apparent that that time that the site didn't really need a backend. 
It could be 100% front-end. Having a server was just an extra cost. The only backend service I was
 really using was the email associated with the domain, which was nice but I could live without.

#### Easier to Move if Content is Markdown
Another reason to finally migrate away from WordPress is that once your blog content is in markdown, 
its easier to jump static site generators as they almost all use markdown. This lets me use my site to try out next technology.



## Why this Tech stack?

Honestly, I picked Next.js and TailwindCSS as my tech stack because
 they were both options I was seeing other people talk about and this was an opportunity to learn about them.

I wouldn't be surprised if I switch to something else that can consume markdown or mdx files in a year to try that too. 

## How Much of a Pain Was Moving It?
Honestly, the most painful part was just copy and pasting all the content from WordPress to the markdown files.

While the SimplyStatic WordPress extension does an AMAZING job at exporting WordPress sites into static HTML, it doesn't export to markdown.
I probably could have found something to programmatically convert the content to markdown, 
but I ended up just starting copy and pasting and got too far in.

You can see exports of the previous WordPress site exported to HTML in [this repository](https://github.com/JustinGOSSES/JustinGOSSES.github.io) 
with the live site as a GitHubPages page here: https://justingosses.github.io/ . 

If you're every shutting down a WordPress site, 
the plugin is a great option for creating an archive version that can be stood up at well. 
There will still be 5-10% functionality that won't work, but its amazing how much it does get right.
