## What was built


## What new capabilities were used?


### Outline of the web application



### Examples



## Post Mortem

### How I used the web application: Tourist trip in France



### Comparing geologic maps as models and large language models. Wrong and useful in different ways

#### Geologic maps as models

#### How map resolution ties to being wrong


#### How purpose of the geologic map ties to it being wrong


#### What type of geology is represented in a map?


#### Don't use Large language models as crystal balls


#### Changing large language models version of resolution


#### Large language models problems with point geology vs reginal geologic content


#### Changing large language models version of purpose


#### Common geographic pitfalls with large language models


## Most common types of errors experienced in France when combining geologic maps and large language models


- Spatial resolution (mostly a geologic map problem)


- Type/Purpose of the map (mostly a geologic map problem... somewhat solvable with LLMs and better programming?)


- What's important to talk about? (mostly a LLM problem)


- Speed (LLM problem... for now)


## Is there value?


### Accessibility?


### Education?

...Scams I see on Twitter

## Uncertainty on how much work to get something useful for non-niche-nerds


Speed

User interface improvements.... better for mobile... other purposes than former geologist tourists with limited time...?

Not sure about how far down you have to go the tail of this type of problem to get something useful?

How to get users to think about their problems and the different types of uncertainty than they are used to?
