# A post mortem on an experimental web application that combined geologic maps with LLMs

When discussing errors of Large Language Models (LLMs) the term 'hallucination' is used
a lot to discuss factual errors. However, this always struck me as a bit of an awkward
framing as LLMs aren't built to be magic either balls that
pull exclusively from repositories of facts. They're built to be probabilistic
models of human language that extend text given in prompts.
The saying that kept popping into my head is instead
one often used to describe scientific models, `"all models are wrong but some are useful".`
I like this saying as it affirms that we LLMs are going to be wrong and we should be
thinking about how we should expect them to be wrong and how to expect them to be
useful.

I also like the saying `"all models are wrong but some are useful"` as it invites
a comparison between geologic maps, which are one type of model, with LLM generated
geology field trip point descriptions, which are a different type of model.
This blog post will in part discuss how geologic maps and LLMs generated geologic
field trip descriptions at specific points in space are wrong in similar and different
ways.

Geology Response: Good morning, everyone! Welcome to our geology field trip. Today, we find ourselves at a fascinating location with a rich geological history. At this point location, the uppermost surface geology is composed of Paleozoic sedimentary rocks and Middle Devonian sedimentary rocks. The Paleozoic sedimentary rocks are from the Paleozoic era, which is 251.902 to 538.8 million years old. The Middle Devonian sedimentary rocks are from the Middle Devonian era, which is 382.7 to 393.3 million years old. Both layers are composed of sedimentary rocks, which were likely deposited in a variety of environments.To understand the geologic story of this area, we need to zoom out and look at the regional geology. Our location lies within the broader context of the Appalachian Basin, which stretches across several states. The Appalachian Basin is a sedimentary basin that formed during the Paleozoic era, and it is known for its extensive deposits of sedimentary rocks.During the Paleozoic era, this region was covered by a shallow sea, known as the Appalachian Basin Sea. The deposition of sediments in this sea resulted in the formation of the Paleozoic sedimentary rocks we see here. These rocks were likely deposited in a variety of environments, including shallow marine, deltaic, and fluvial settings. Over millions of years, layers upon layers of sediment accumulated, compacted, and lithified to form the rock formations we observe today.Moving forward in time, we come to the Middle Devonian era. During this period, the sea that once covered this region began to recede, and the environment transitioned from marine to terrestrial. The Middle Devonian sedimentary rocks we see here were likely deposited in a variety of environments, including river systems, floodplains, and deltas. These rocks provide valuable insights into the ancient landscapes and ecosystems that existed during this time.As we examine the outcrop in front of us, we can observe the distinct layering and sedimentary structures within the rocks. These features tell us about the processes that shaped this area millions of years ago. We may also find fossils within these sedimentary rocks, which can provide clues about the ancient organisms that once inhabited this region.In conclusion, the geologic story of this location is one of ancient seas, changing environments, and the deposition of sedimentary rocks over millions of years. The Paleozoic and Middle Devonian sedimentary rocks we see here are a testament to the dynamic geological history of the Appalachian Basin. So, let's take a closer look at the rocks, examine their characteristics, and see what else we can uncover about the fascinating geology of this area.

Location: latitude = 29.760082, longitude = -95.432943

Geology Response: Good morning, everyone! Welcome to our geology field trip. Today, we find ourselves at latitude 29.760082 and longitude -95.432943, where we have a fantastic opportunity to explore the fascinating geologic history of this region.At this point location, the uppermost surface geology is composed of Pleistocene sedimentary rocks, which date back to approximately 0.0117 million years ago. These sedimentary rocks were formed during the Pleistocene Epoch, a time characterized by repeated glaciations and interglacial periods. The Pleistocene sediments here consist of various types of sedimentary rocks, such as sand, silt, and clay, which were deposited by rivers, wind, and other natural processes.Beneath the Pleistocene sediments, we have the Beaumont Formation, which is composed primarily of clay and silt. This formation dates back to around 0.6558 million years ago and provides us with valuable insights into the geological processes that shaped this region. The Beaumont Formation was deposited in flood basins, coastal lakes, and former stream channels on a deltaic plain.Now, let's zoom out and take a look at the broader regional geology. Our current location lies within the Gulf Coastal Plain, a vast region that stretches from the Gulf of Mexico to the interior of the continent. This plain is characterized by a relatively flat topography and is primarily composed of sedimentary rocks.The Gulf Coastal Plain was formed over millions of years through the deposition of sediments eroded from the surrounding highlands and carried by rivers and streams. These sediments were then deposited in various environments, including river floodplains, deltas, and coastal areas, resulting in the diverse sedimentary rock formations we see today.Throughout its geologic history, this region has experienced significant changes in sea level, climate, and tectonic activity, all of which have influenced the deposition and erosion of sediments. The repeated cycles of sea-level rise and fall during the Pleistocene Epoch, for example, played a crucial role in shaping the landscape we see today.In addition to the Pleistocene and Beaumont Formation, other notable rock units in this region include the Lissie Formation, the Frio Formation, and the Yegua Formation, each representing different periods of deposition and environmental conditions.As we continue our field trip, I encourage you all to observe the various rock outcrops and formations we encounter along the way. By studying the geology of this region, we can gain a deeper understanding of the Earth's dynamic processes and the intricate history that has shaped our surroundings.Let's move on and explore more of the fascinating geology this region has to offer.

Location: latitude = 9.344765, longitude = -82.170057

Geology Response: Good morning, students! Welcome to our geology field trip. Today, we find ourselves at a fascinating location with coordinates latitude = 9.344765 and longitude = -82.170057. As we observe the rock outcrop in front of us, we can see that the uppermost surface geology is Neogene sedimentary.This layer of sedimentary rocks tells us a story about the geologic history of this region. The Neogene period, which began approximately 2.58 million years ago and ended around 23.03 million years ago, was a time of significant geological activity. During this period, the Earth experienced major climatic changes and the emergence of diverse life forms.The presence of sedimentary rocks suggests that this area was once a sedimentary environment, such as a river delta or a shallow marine environment. Sedimentary rocks are formed through the accumulation and compaction of sediments, which can include materials like sand, silt, and clay. Over time, these sediments become lithified, forming solid rock layers.Now, let's zoom out and consider the regional geology. Our current location lies within the broader context of Central America, a region known for its complex tectonic history. Central America is situated at the boundary between the Caribbean Plate and the Cocos Plate, which are both part of the larger tectonic puzzle in this area.The collision and subduction of these plates have played a significant role in shaping the geology of Central America. The ongoing subduction of the Cocos Plate beneath the Caribbean Plate has led to the formation of volcanic arcs, such as the Central American Volcanic Arc, which stretches from Guatemala to Panama.In addition to volcanic activity, the tectonic forces at play have also resulted in the formation of mountain ranges and the uplifting of sedimentary basins. These processes have contributed to the deposition of sedimentary rocks, like the ones we see here, as well as the creation of diverse landscapes and ecosystems.Furthermore, Central America has a rich history of seismic activity due to the tectonic forces in the region. Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are common occurrences, reminding us of the dynamic nature of our planet.In conclusion, the Neogene sedimentary rocks we observe at this location provide a glimpse into the geological history of Central America. They tell a story of ancient sedimentation in a sedimentary environment, shaped by the tectonic forces and volcanic activity that have shaped this region over millions of years. As we continue our field trip, let's keep our eyes open for more clues and evidence of the fascinating geologic processes that have shaped this part of the world.

Geology Response: Welcome, students, to this exciting geology field trip! Today, we find ourselves at a fascinating location with coordinates latitude = 25.178327 and longitude = -238.437555. Direct your attention to the rock outcrop in front of us, which provides a glimpse into the geologic history of this region.At this point location, the uppermost surface geology is composed of intermediate volcanic rocks from the Pliocene epoch, approximately 5.333 million years ago. Although the thickness of this layer is unknown, it is a significant clue to understanding the regional geology.To fully comprehend the geologic story of this area, we must consider the broader context. The Pliocene epoch was a time of intense volcanic activity in this region. The volcanic rocks we observe here were formed through the eruption of magma from the Earth's mantle. These eruptions were likely associated with the movement of tectonic plates and the creation of new crust.As we delve deeper into the regional geology, we discover that this area is part of a larger volcanic arc. Volcanic arcs are formed when one tectonic plate subducts beneath another, leading to the melting of the subducting plate and the subsequent eruption of magma. This process is known as subduction, and it results in the formation of volcanic mountains and the release of volcanic gases.The presence of intermediate volcanic rocks suggests that this region experienced a subduction event involving the convergence of two tectonic plates. The magma that formed these rocks likely originated from the partial melting of the subducting plate, which was rich in silica and other minerals. As the magma rose to the surface, it cooled and solidified, forming the volcanic rocks we see today.Furthermore, the age of these volcanic rocks provides valuable information about the tectonic history of this region. The Pliocene epoch corresponds to a time when the tectonic plates in this area were actively converging. This convergence resulted in the formation of a volcanic arc, which extended along the western margin of the continent.In conclusion, the intermediate volcanic rocks we observe at this point location offer a glimpse into the dynamic geologic history of this region. They indicate a period of intense volcanic activity during the Pliocene epoch, likely associated with the subduction of tectonic plates and the formation of a volcanic arc. By studying these rocks and their context within the regional geology, we can gain valuable insights into the processes that have shaped our planet over millions of years.

## Post Mortem

### How I used the web application: Tourist trip in France

## Non-model related areas of poor user experience

### Too slow

The text generation involved multiple OpenAI and other API models, which meant
the time between clicking the "generate" button and getting a description of
the field trip location could be several minutes in total. This is too slow
for many users, who are used to immediate feedback on websites. One way to
minimize this might be to have the intermediate results printed to the
website window as well. This the experience when running via command line
and it results in less waiting but not zero waiting.

### Poor experience on a mobile device

This prototype was developed quickly on a laptop, and it has not been
optimized for a mobile experience. There are two elements that could be
improved. First, the four map elements appear in the same locations
on small mobile screens, which makes it hard to see fine details.
Ideally, on mobile each map window would be full screen width and
positioned in a vertical column of elements. This would make them
easier to see. Second, the small size makes it annoying to navigte the map.
Having each map element be full screen width would help with navigation
of the map, but ideally there would also be a button to push to
navigate the map to your actual location and an input form where you
could type in an address for the maps to navigate to. Both of these
would improve the map navigation experience on mobile.

### Comparing geologic maps as models and large language models. Wrong and useful in different ways

#### Geologic maps as models

#### How map resolution ties to being wrong

#### How purpose of the geologic map ties to it being wrong

#### What type of geology is represented in a map?

#### Don't use Large language models as crystal balls

#### Changing large language models version of resolution

#### Large language models problems with point geology vs reginal geologic content

#### Changing large language models version of purpose

#### Common geographic pitfalls with large language models

## Most common types of errors experienced in France when combining geologic maps and large language models

- Spatial resolution (mostly a geologic map problem)

- Type/Purpose of the map (mostly a geologic map problem... somewhat solvable with LLMs and better programming?)

- What's important to talk about? (mostly a LLM problem)

- Speed (LLM problem... for now)

## Is there value?

### Accessibility?

### Education?

...Scams I see on Twitter

## Uncertainty on how much work to get something useful for non-niche-nerds

Not sure about how far down you have to go the tail of this type of problem to get something useful?

How to get users to think about their problems and the different types of uncertainty than they are used to?
