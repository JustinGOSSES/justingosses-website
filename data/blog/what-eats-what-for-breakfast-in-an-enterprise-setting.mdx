## Introduction
A while back I saw a thread on [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/), a social network that I use, where someone said 
"Tools eat process for breakfast" while discussing 
[this substack article](https://benn.substack.com/p/the-product-is-the-process).

"Tools eat process for breakfast" is a variation on the more traditional 
["culture eats strategy for breakfast"](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/05/23/culture-eats/), 
which got me thinking about what else eats what for breakfast. Although I often see these essays 
in the format of what eats what for breakfast, the variations got my thinking
that there is definitely more than two things to compare and therefore an ordered list would be more appropriate. 

The list below is my quick attempt at such a list. Items higher on the list eat items lower on the list for breakfast.

## An ordered list of things that eat each other for breakfast
- Human nature
- Tools people use regularly
- Culture
- Process
- Strategy
- Asking people nicely
- Telling people they should do things

#### Definitions
I will say that where I am uncertain in this ranking, it is due to fuzzy definitions. 
Culture, process, and strategy are all very fuzzy terms with significant overlap. 
Some writers will put significant parts of process in culture. 
For the purposes of this list, I am 
defining strategy as asking people to do things from the highest levels of the organization that are either 
goal related or broadly defined changes in execution style. Process 
is defined as workflows people use that are not necessarily tools or are borderline tools in the sense 
of homegrown enterprise-wide tooling that assists in enterprise workflows. Tools people use 
reguarly means the default tools and applications provided to people to get most of their work done.
Culture is defined as everything 
others might define as culture excluding what I have defined as tools, process, or strategy. 

## Why is this list useful?
Despite the uncertainty in the ordering, I think this list is useful. If you want to deliver change, and 
try to do so through something lower on the list, you might be surprised to find that it doesn't work, 
because you are pushing against a forcing factor higher up the list. 

For example, let us say you want people to eat more vegetables, you might try to do so by telling people 
to eat their broccoli. This might work, but it is more likely that you will be successful if you change 
what food is available in the cafeteria. 
"Tools people use regularly" eats "asking people nicely" for breakfast, even if what you're asking people to do 
is is a smart and reasonable thing to do

If you do a [web search](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=culture+eats+strategy+for+breakfast&ia=web) for "culture eats strategy for breakfast", you will find a lot of articles that give 
many more examples.

The "blank" eats "blank" for breakfast framing is one way to think about change in an organization 
that highlights where you might be pushing against an unindentified brick wall.

## Why this order?
The list is in this order because people are busy, have limited time, have poor memory of what has been recommended, 
and are constrained by tools and workflows provided to them. 
The items lower on the list require people to actively think 
and taking action. Some my require direct person to person communication. The items higher on the list tend to be
more passive, unconscious and automatic, or the only way to get tasks done. What wins out in the end is what 
people do without thinking when they are busy and trying to get other things done.

## Ways to push for change lower on the list are sometimes the only option
Although the lower items on the list are stopped by items higher up at time, lower items may sometimes be 
the only option or the best option for pushing change. Items higher up the list are more difficult to change or 
owned by only a few people. What tools are widely distributed, or even allowed, tends to be owned by a small group.
Who can push strategy at scale is likewise often limited to a few people in the organization.

In situations where pushing for change through lower items on the list is the only option, it may be 
important to understand if there is a pathway for those actions to eventually trigger change higher up the list. 
For example, can pushing for change to strategy trigger changes in default tooling? Alternatively, can asking nicely 
for tooling exceptions eventually trigger changes in default tooling?

## Are lower items in this list useful pathways to change or dead ends?

Sometimes change in a small number of people or for a short period of time is all you need. 
Other times you need to change the default behavior of the organization. 
If you are trying to change the default behavior of the organization and lower items in the list 
are the only ones available to you, you need to understand if small change can trigger larger change or whether you are 
pushing towards a dead end. 

Will "human nature", "tools", "culture", or "process" eat your "asking nicely" efforts for breakfast?

My mastadon quote that prompted this thought:

```
Don’t agree with everything but agree with the header “Tools eat process for breakfast” a thousand times over.

https://benn.substack.com/p/the-product-is-the-process
```

Maybe should have added strategy in there between process and asking nicely?
/// - Human Abilities
- Human nature
- Tools people use regularly
- Culture
- Process
- Strategy
- Asking people nicely
- Telling people they should do things

### prompted
This article prompted me to think about different things that eat each other for breakfast. 
It really isn't just two things. You can go farther and make an ordered list. 

This type of list is useful as there can be times as you try to push a change using a method that's farther 
down the list. You might do a lot of pushing, but get no results as something else is stopping it farther 
up the list. 

You can ask people to do something nicely, but if their tools that they use every day make it hard to do, it 
is likely it won't get done or will happen for a while then stop being done. Use patterns, user interfaces, and 
limitations of regularly used tools trump asking someone to do something. 

Now, this isn't the case always, but it is probably going to be the case a majority of the time. The 
purpose of this sorta of ordered list isn't that it's a set of rules, but rather a pattern in terms of 
what will win out most of the time. 

If you want to deliver change at scale, better to be impacting higher up in the list when and where you can. 

How often can you really change "tools used regularly" thought? Probably not often. It is most easier to impact 
something by asking people and sometimes that's the only option. 

Culture takes power and time to impact. Tool changes are infrequent opportunities that come up. 

Adding a process, evolving a process, or merely influencing how it gets expressed has costs. 

There's only a limited amount of strategy that can be executed against at any one point in time.

“Culture Eats Strategy For Breakfast” - What Does it Mean?
https://www.thealternativeboard.com/blog/culture-eats-strategy


Culture eats strategy for breakfast
https://www.managementcentre.co.uk/management-consultancy/culture-eats-strategy-for-breakfast/

The six elements they defined are:

    Stories and myths: 
      covers events and people discussed inside and outside the organisation. So who are the heroes and heroines – and who are the villains? This categorisation guides on what is seen as success. So consider the way in which Steve Jobs was in regarded in Apple. (And John Scully?)
    Rituals and routines: 
      covers the patterns of systematic behaviour that are seen as normal. Usually this determines what’s supposed to happen in a particular situation. These rituals can be positive – supporting colleagues, responding to customer queries in 24 hrs. But they can be negative – bullying, sexism, etc. So think of some rituals in the armed forces – both +ive and –ive.
    Symbols – every office has symbols: 
      from who has a corner or separate office to the daily dress code or who can fly business class. Symbols can extend to the branding – fun or serious – and the ways the organisation portrays itself through what it sponsors. Think of Google’s obsession with showing slides and table tennis in the office. The symbolism is college meets work.
    Organisational structure: 
      the organogram is one formal representation of structure – who reports to who. But there are other power structures in an organisation – around what Malcolm Gladwell calls social power. Theatres are interesting organisations where the star performer may have more power than the director – who is theoretically in charge.
    Control systems: 
      every organisation has ‘controls.’ These include systems for setting and maintaining standards for finance and quality. They may also include reward and promotion systems. Some organisations have strict standards – office time, use of emails etc. And some are looser. But these can change: consider the impact of Nick Leason-type scandals on banking.
    Power structures: some people or groups have significant decision-making powers within an organisation. These structures can be formal – the CEO, the SMT or the Board. Or they can be informal – perhaps a strong trades union able to derail or sanction decisions. Think of the RMT union in the London Transport system.



## Implications for InnerSource

A lot of the writing on expanding InnerSource in companies focuses on process, asking people nicely, and 
telling people they should do things. To some extent, this is because if you're pushing InnerSource and 
trying to change an organization to adapt it more, that's what you likely have the power to affect. 

That being said, it is still worthwhile to consider high order items on the "eats __ for breakfast" list when 
opportunities to do so arise. 

Sometimes there are opportunities to push certain tools. Other times there are enterprise extensions of tools. 
Enterprise extensions or front-doors tool usage provid opportunities to influence workflows at scale. There are 
huge opportunities that shouldn't be passed up. 

People pushing InnerSource probably aren't setting company-wide culture or strategy. However, that initiatives, slogans, 
and values associated with corporate culture and strategy can be leveraged to push InnerSource where alignment 
presents itself. These again, are opportunities to jump onto and build on the work of others, rather than self
contained initiatives of individuals or groups pushing for more InnerSoure. 

## Why Other Writing Just Talks About Two?
- Cleaner comparison.
- Othen used as a framework to talk about some other smaller more tactical point. 
- Talking about doing one without the other is a recipe for failure.
