### NOTES:

#### Web Information:

My mastadon quote that prompted this thought:

```
Don’t agree with everything but agree with the header “Tools eat process for breakfast” a thousand times over.

My sorted list of who eats who for breakfast is:
- Human nature
- Tools people use regularly
- Culture
- Process
- Asking people nicely
- Telling people they should do things

```

Maybe should have added strategy in there between process and asking nicely?
- Human Abilities
- Human nature
- Tools people use regularly
- Culture
- Process
- Strategy
- Asking people nicely
- Telling people they should do things

### prompted
This article prompted me to think about different things that eat each other for breakfast. 
It really isn't just two things. You can go farther and make an ordered list. 

This type of list is useful as there can be times as you try to push a change using a method that's farther 
down the list. You might do a lot of pushing, but get no results as something else is stopping it farther 
up the list. 

You can ask people to do something nicely, but if their tools that they use every day make it hard to do, it 
is likely it won't get done or will happen for a while then stop being done. Use patterns, user interfaces, and 
limitations of regularly used tools trump asking someone to do something. 

Now, this isn't the case always, but it is probably going to be the case a majority of the time. The 
purpose of this sorta of ordered list isn't that it's a set of rules, but rather a pattern in terms of 
what will win out most of the time. 

If you want to deliver change at scale, better to be impacting higher up in the list when and where you can. 

How often can you really change "tools used regularly" thought? Probably not often. It is most easier to impact 
something by asking people and sometimes that's the only option. 

Culture takes power and time to impact. Tool changes are infrequent opportunities that come up. 

Adding a process, evolving a process, or merely influencing how it gets expressed has costs. 

There's only a limited amount of strategy that can be executed against at any one point in time.

“Culture Eats Strategy For Breakfast” - What Does it Mean?
https://www.thealternativeboard.com/blog/culture-eats-strategy


Culture eats strategy for breakfast
https://www.managementcentre.co.uk/management-consultancy/culture-eats-strategy-for-breakfast/

The six elements they defined are:

    Stories and myths: 
      covers events and people discussed inside and outside the organisation. So who are the heroes and heroines – and who are the villains? This categorisation guides on what is seen as success. So consider the way in which Steve Jobs was in regarded in Apple. (And John Scully?)
    Rituals and routines: 
      covers the patterns of systematic behaviour that are seen as normal. Usually this determines what’s supposed to happen in a particular situation. These rituals can be positive – supporting colleagues, responding to customer queries in 24 hrs. But they can be negative – bullying, sexism, etc. So think of some rituals in the armed forces – both +ive and –ive.
    Symbols – every office has symbols: 
      from who has a corner or separate office to the daily dress code or who can fly business class. Symbols can extend to the branding – fun or serious – and the ways the organisation portrays itself through what it sponsors. Think of Google’s obsession with showing slides and table tennis in the office. The symbolism is college meets work.
    Organisational structure: 
      the organogram is one formal representation of structure – who reports to who. But there are other power structures in an organisation – around what Malcolm Gladwell calls social power. Theatres are interesting organisations where the star performer may have more power than the director – who is theoretically in charge.
    Control systems: 
      every organisation has ‘controls.’ These include systems for setting and maintaining standards for finance and quality. They may also include reward and promotion systems. Some organisations have strict standards – office time, use of emails etc. And some are looser. But these can change: consider the impact of Nick Leason-type scandals on banking.
    Power structures: some people or groups have significant decision-making powers within an organisation. These structures can be formal – the CEO, the SMT or the Board. Or they can be informal – perhaps a strong trades union able to derail or sanction decisions. Think of the RMT union in the London Transport system.



## Implications for InnerSource

A lot of the writing on expanding InnerSource in companies focuses on process, asking people nicely, and 
telling people they should do things. To some extent, this is because if you're pushing InnerSource and 
trying to change an organization to adapt it more, that's what you likely have the power to affect. 

That being said, it is still worthwhile to consider high order items on the "eats __ for breakfast" list when 
opportunities to do so arise. 

Sometimes there are opportunities to push certain tools. Other times there are enterprise extensions of tools. 
Enterprise extensions or front-doors tool usage provid opportunities to influence workflows at scale. There are 
huge opportunities that shouldn't be passed up. 

People pushing InnerSource probably aren't setting company-wide culture or strategy. However, that initiatives, slogans, 
and values associated with corporate culture and strategy can be leveraged to push InnerSource where alignment 
presents itself. These again, are opportunities to jump onto and build on the work of others, rather than self
contained initiatives of individuals or groups pushing for more InnerSoure. 

## Why Other Writing Just Talks About Two?
- Cleaner comparison.
- Othen used as a framework to talk about some other smaller more tactical point. 
- Talking about doing one without the other is a recipe for failure.
