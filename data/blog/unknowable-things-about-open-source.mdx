## Seven things about open source that we don't tend to know. 
1. We do not know where it goes.
2. We do not know what all exists that would be helpful to us.
3. We do not think too much about why we consume one dependency versus another dependency.
4. We sometimes do not know why we write it.
5. We very often do not know why other people write it. 
6. We have no idea whether it will be okay to use in the future.
7. We have no idea whether other people will use it.

For each type of thing we don't tend to know: 
- Definition
- Is that ignorance in some way sometimes helpful?
- Might instead reducing that ignorance might be helpful in some ways?
- Forces that might change the status quo of knowledge??
- How we might know these things more often?

#### Trends that will be mentioned below:
A. Metadata infrastructure is getting better over time
B. More focus on vulnerabilities
C. Open Source license changing to BUSL other non-open-source licenses

## (1) Where do others do with your open source?
#### _Definition:_ 


### _Ignorance helpful?:_


### _Less Ignorance helpful?:_


### _Forces that might change this?_


### _How might we know this more often?_


## (2) What open source exists that is useful to you?
#### _Definition:_ 


### _Ignorance helpful?:_


### _Less Ignorance helpful?:_


### _Forces that might change this?_


### _How might we know this more often?_




## (3) Why did you end up consuming each of those dependencies?
#### _Definition:_ 


### _Ignorance helpful?:_


### _Less Ignorance helpful?:_


### _Forces that might change this?_


### _How might we know this more often?_




## (4) Almost no one writes code for the good of humanity, why do you write open source?
#### _Definition:_ 


### _Ignorance helpful?:_


### _Less Ignorance helpful?:_


### _Forces that might change this?_


### _How might we know this more often?_




## (5) Why do other people write open source because it sure isn't for the good of humanity?
#### _Definition:_ 


### _Ignorance helpful?:_


### _Less Ignorance helpful?:_


### _Forces that might change this?_


### _How might we know this more often?_




## (6) Are you supremely confident that package will be maintained until the heat death of the universe?
#### _Definition:_ 


### _Ignorance helpful?:_


### _Less Ignorance helpful?:_


### _Forces that might change this?_


### _How might we know this more often?_




## (7) Will anyone use that thing you're spending so much time on when you do the equivelant of leaving it in the drive-way with a cardboard 'free' sign?
#### _Definition:_ 


### _Ignorance helpful?:_


### _Less Ignorance helpful?:_


### _Forces that might change this?_


### _How might we know this more often?_


## Conclusion
### How do these types of ignorances help to define the experience of creating or working with open source software?


### What could the future hold?
