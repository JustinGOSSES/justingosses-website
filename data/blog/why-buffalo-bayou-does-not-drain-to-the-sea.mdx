# Context

First, the title is a bit of misnomer to make it sound more interesting. Buffalo Bayou does, of course,
drain to the sea, but it does so by flowing east to the Galveston Bay first, then it flows to the Gulf of Mexico. 
Flowing west to east is a bit different than many other rivers in the area, which tend to flow south south east. 
This post is about what a relative elevation map referenced against large rivers and coastline can 
tell us about why Buffalo Bayou flows east instead of south south east like many rivers in the area.

This blog post will entirely consist of making observations regarding a relative elevation map (REM)
created from a digital elevation map (DEM) of the greater Houston area. 
The REM was created as part of looking at data for a Houston Geologic Society working group looking
at better understanding the geology of the Buffalo Bayou. This post is not about that larger geological
story but simply what you can see in the DEM and REM.

## What is a Digital Elevation Map (DEM) and Relative Elevation Map (REM)

### Digital Elevation Map (DEM)
A digital elevation map (DEM) is a 3D representation of a terrain's surface.
It is a raster file that contains elevation values for specific points on the terrain.
DEMs are like contoured topography maps, but they have a higher resolution and are more detailed with each 
pixel representing a specific elevation value.

#### Data for the DEM 

The digital elevation model or DEM used in this repository
came from [Open Topography's](https://opentopography.org/) topographic data locator and download tools. 

The dataset itself is sourced from USGS (United Stats Geologic Survey), specifically the 
USGS 1/3 arc-second Digital Elevation Model(USGS10m).

This material was based on data, processing services provided by the OpenTopography Facility with support from 
the National Science Foundation under NSF Award Numbers 1833703, 1833643, and 1833632.

The full metadata details of the downloaded data can be found in the metadata file 
at [https://portal.opentopography.org/rasterOutput?jobId=rt1716147037733&metadata=1](https://portal.opentopography.org/rasterOutput?jobId=rt1716147037733&metadata=1)

Due to size constraints, most of the images in this blog post will be screenshots and not at full resolution.

### Relative Elevation Map (REM)

DEMs are great by themselves for many applications, but there are times when fine details in topography
are very hard to see in them due to the total range of elevation values captured in the map.
One way to show those fine details at the expense of accurate showing the total range of elevation is a
REM. In a relative elevation map, the elevation of a point is shown as the difference between the elevation 
of that point and some other often calculated average or nearest point.
One way to think of a REM is as a map that shows the difference in elevation between two points.
The second point can be the average elevation of the area with a half miles circle, or it can be
the elevation of the nearest river centerline. Making REMs referenced to river center lines can be useful
for understanding small variations in topography in relation to the river's path and that was used in
the images in this blog post.

#### RiverREM
Specifically, I used the RiverREM Python package by
Larrieu, K. (2022). RiverREM (Version 1.0.4) [Computer software]. https://github.com/OpenTopography/RiverREM
A great description of how and why to use it can be found in 
[an Open Topography blog post](https://opentopography.org/blog/new-package-automates-river-relative-elevation-model-rem-generation)

I used the default configuration for the most part. The only change I made was to not let the program find the
largest river in the area of the DEM. While the RiverREM package assumes you're looking at the floodplain
for a single river, I was looking taking a regional view with many rivers in the area of interest as well
as bays and coastlines. Therefore, I parsed river center lines, coastline, and lakes while ignoring smaller
water bodies like marshes, ponds, and drainage ditches from 
[a collection of shape files](https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/nhdplus-texas-data-vector-processing-unit-12) 
put out by the USGS & EPA are region 12 of the 
[National Hydrology Dataset or NHD](https://www.usgs.gov/national-hydrography/national-hydrography-dataset). 
The code will eventually put out on a public GitHub repository once I clean the git history of the 
large TIF files. 

## Where are we

![texas state map with data extent](../static/images/blog/bayou/Texas_vs_rem.png)

The bluish square on this map of Texas is the extent of the Houston region REM data. 
The hard to see scale bar in the lower left corner represents the scale of 255 miles.

![Relative elevation map of Houston region](../static/images/blog/bayou/Houston_REM.png)
Greater Houston area relative elevation map. 
The colors represent approximately the difference in elevation between the point and the nearest river centerline.
Hence, there's no point in adding a scale bar as the colors are relative not absolute.


## Coastal plain with actual topography vs. pancake coastal plain

![Relative Elevation Model image with pancake edge in white line](../static/images/blog/bayou/pancake_edge.png)
White line marks approximate edge of pancake coastal plain vs. coastal plain with slight topography.

One of the things apparent in the REM is that there is a change in topgraphic patterns that runs diagonally
across the map southwest to northeast. This line is marked by the white line in the image above.
Above that line you have slight rolling hills and valley formed by regular erosional dendretic river drainage.
Below that line, there's more of pattern of a flag pancake with rivers either plowing a valley through it 
or eroding sharp channels into it as will be discussed later. 
Although I've drawn it as a straight line, I am not sure it is necessarily always a sharp line in reality. 

I suspect that change in topography represents the max extent to which sea level's fairly direct influence 
on deposition and erosion patterns has reached. When rivers are close to sea level, there isn't gravitational
energy to erode much of a valley or transport sediment and materials either immediately or progressively over
time spread out and form a very even topography.

### local erosional rivers vs. pass through rivers: Watershed extent

Another observations that's easy to make looking at the REM is that there are two 
obvious classes of rivers. One is larger with active channels moving through larger valleys to either 
a sea or bay. These have large drainage areas out of view of the REM. 
Brazos River, San Jacinto, and Trinity are all examples.

The other class of rivers are smaller with morphology that seems much more erosional without as much visible 
evidence of storing reworked sediment in their much smaller values. They other have more branching behaviors 
as well. These rivers are more local to the area of the REM and have much smaller drainage areas.
Buffalo Bayou, Sims Bayou, Brays Bayou, and Clear Creek are examples.

#### Pass through rivers: Valley morphology

![Relative Elevation Model image of Trinity River](../static/images/blog/bayou/Trinity.png)
Trinity river relative elevation map north east of Houston. Shows large valley morphology 
with history of meanders eroding and depositing into each other over time and small erosional
cuts draining into the valley form its side.

![Relative Elevation Model image of Trinity with elevation profile](../static/images/blog/bayou/Trinity_EP.png)
An elevation profile of the same area, shows the valley contains a large amount of abandoned channels 
and bars with a smaller active channel and comparatively steep valley sides.

#### Local erosional rivers: Valley morphology

![Relative Elevation Model image of Buffalo Bayou](../static/images/blog/bayou/BuffaloBayou_dendretic.png)
Buffalo bayou's channel has much less of an oversized valley relative to size of current flow. 
It comparitively less preserved meanders and many more dendretic channels flowing into it, given
the impression of a more erosional river with less sediment transport compared to the Trinity, 
at least based on morphology expressed in the REM alone.

![Relative Elevation Model image of Buffalo Bayou with elevation profile](../static/images/blog/bayou/BuffaloBayou_EP.png)
Elevation profile of Buffalo Bayou.

The elevation profile cuts through the main Buffalo Bayou channel and several small tributaries that drain into it. 
Channels are relatively sharp and narrow with active river channel being a single order fraction of the width.

### Differences in drainage area

--------
_TODO: show polygons & stats for buffalo bayou, sims bayou, etc. watershed acreage vs. Brazos._

TODO: Suggest local rivers are smaller time scale responses to where is lower topgraphy

TODO: Suggest regional rivers are longer lasting river that reach the sea somewhere
--------

### Brazos vs. other pass through rivers: sediment supply

TODO: Show how Brazos currently reaches the sea vs. other rivers that reach bay. It fills up its valley with sediment.


TODO: Introduce concept of brazos river delta lobes and levees 


#### Local erosional rivers: Drainage direction

TODO: Suggest buffalo bayou west-east direction only seems odd as its one of the larger coastal plain constrained rivers
whose direction is controlled by whatever is locally lowest topography. Smaller bayous actually have less tendendcy to 
flow to sea.

TODO: Make case that Trinity & San Jacinto rivers not reaching the sea has been constant enough since 
Brazos levees / delta deposited sediment that there's been a decently long pattern of that bay and/or channel
being lowest path, not directly to sea to south. This has been due to high sediment supply 
coming down Brazos and lower amounts of sediment coming out of San Jacinto & Trinity. 

TODO: Plot
- area of present day Brazos vs. San Jacinto vs. Trinity
- elevation change of Braoze vs. San Jacinto vs. Trinity

#### local erosional rivers valley morphology and branching morphology

- faults and salt bodies that sometimes push rivers around a little

TODO: Examples of effects and non-effects.

TODO: Make case structural forces cause tiny short spatial and time scale effects in river paths, not 
large scale direction of drainage.

## Conclusion: Why does Buffalo Bayou flow west to east?

Blame 
1. the pancake coastal plain caused by gradual tectonics and sea level change.
2. the high sediment coming out of the Brazos forming levees and delta lobes and preventing a bay
3. the relatively low amount of sediment coming out of the Trinity leads to an eroded channel during lower sea level that forms a unfilled in bay during higher sea levels.

This tilts the pancake surface between the Brazos and the Trinity ensuring the quickest route to the sea level is east, not south.
