## Houston context

Houston rarely has snow and when it does it tends to be a dusting. 
Tomorrow, there is 2-6 inches forecast, which is enough to sledding.

That leads us to the question of where to go sledding.
As discussed in
[this previous blog post](https://justingosses.com/blog/why-buffalo-bayou-does-not-drain-to-the-sea)
Houston is pancake flat coastal plain. There are not many hills,
but we can use LIDAR data (elevation data sourced by shooting lasers
from an airplane) to see the limited togography that does exist.


## Author context

As someone who grew up in northern Ohio, snow and sledding was a big
part of my childhood that simply doesn't exist in Houston.
In Ohio, there's well known good sledding hills that people will
walk or drive to when it snows. Often these are at a park.
People know to walk up the sides, slide down the middle.
There's no social understanding of "good sledding hills" in Houston.

## Where might there be enough potential energy to sled in Houston?

#### Miller Outdoor Theater in Herman park

In the January 20, 2025 at 7:53am post on Space City Weather by Eric Berger,
they listed the Miller outdoor theater in Herman park as a potential sledding hill.

Space City Weather also said, 
*"when choosing a locale for sledding on Tuesday (and possibly Wednesday) it would be foolish to choose a spot you have to drive to."*
While driving to the "neighborhood sledding hill" is normal in Ohio,
the city of Houston probably has near zero snow plows and drivers often have little
experience driving in slow, so the roads will be an icy mess.

**Hence, it will be important to find a local sledding hill that one can walk to!**

### Options in Buffalo Bayou Park aka Allen Parkway

Buffalo Bayou Park is a large park that runs along Buffalo bayou just west of downtown Houston.
It has a lot of open space and a few hills. 

**However, most of those hills flow into the bayou, which makes them a very bad idea for sledding!**
For those new to sledding, you can't stop unless you run out of energy.
Therefore, you need a hill that doesn't end in a river even if it is near the river.
There are  a few options that seem to meet this criteria.



####  Nau Family Pavilion at Eleanor Tinsley Park along Buffalo Bayou

Eleanor Tinsley Park is a part of Buffalo Bayou Park and the Nau Family Pavilion sits at the top
of one of the few hills that runs parallel to the Bayou rather than into it.
There is also sidewalk and parking lot access on the south side.

This location has a steep start and a long run-out that is flat with no observations, which is ideal for sledding.
