<p>This week I presentedÂ on the last 40 years of digital data visualization tools at <a href="https://fal.jsc.nasa.gov/DSD/">Johnson Space Center Data Science Day</a>. The event was held just off site this year, so it could be opened up to the public. The talk was a condensed, and I think improved, version of a talk I had previous gave at a data visualization meet-up. This version was shorter by half and focused just on the tool evolution, as opposed to the previous talk which tried to also cover the context of these tools in large organizations.</p>
