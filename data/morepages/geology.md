## About Me

I’ve always been interested in the ability of geology to narrate the past. Professionally, I’ve focused on reducing uncertainty and enabling decisions through data analysis and data visualization.


## Where I’ve Worked

There is a geologist saying that whoever sees the most rocks wins. I’ve not seen the most rocks, but I’ve done alright. Clicking on the map will take you to a live interactive version of all the rocks I’ve worked with. Clicking on each dot brings up more information.

## Professional Societies (previous)

    - Gulf Coast Section of the SEPM (Society of Sedimentary Geologists)
        - social media chair
    - The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS)

## Oil & Gas

I worked for BP exploration and production for nine years, including two years as an expat in the Calgary, Canada office. For additional details, please see the RESUME page.
Academic Research

At Franklin and Marshall College, I completed two research projects. One was a test project for how well a magnetic-based dating method worked on an Etruscan age archaeology site in Italy. The other project was a description of Cretaceous-age outcrops containing rift lake sediments in Mongolia. In graduate school at University of Wisconsin-Madison, my research used Argon-Argon dating and field work to describe the stratigraphic history of the 52 million year-old caldera lake (inside a volcano) in Argentina.
Sedimentology & Stratigraphy

Although I have often worked as an integrated geologist across a range of sub-fields, my deepest skill set is in sedimentology and stratigraphy. I have held sed/strat positions within BP, including as an internal consultant loaned to various teams. I presented regularly at sed/strat technical lunch talks, mentored junior geologists, gave core room talks, and assisted in field trips and courses.
Geology & Code

These days my day job doesn’t involve a lot of geology, augmented reality sandboxes excluded. However, I manage to stay involved via side projects that sit at the intersection of geology and code. Examples include the open-source projects Predictatops (Python-based machine-learning prediction of stratigraphic surfaces) and wellioviz (JavaScript-based visualization library for well logs built on top of d3.js). Both are things I’ve long thought should exist, so it has been fun to bring them into the world of the possible.##
