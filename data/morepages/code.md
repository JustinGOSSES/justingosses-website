## About My Code Side-Projects
Side projects are a major way I add to my skills, so I always have several in development or on the to-do list.

Putting them in a list is a bit of a self-hack to limit the sprawl and push things to completion. 
It serves as a good reminder what isn't completely done and helps to prioritize.

### What types of code do I write?
I write machine-learning, data visualization, and web development code. Mostly, I write in Python or JavaScript with smaller amounts of Ruby, R, PHP, sed/awk, C++, and Java. A lot of my side projects are in JavaScript as it is the easiest for me to jump into and quickly produce something with an easy to share visual.

### Previous Side-Projects
- Assembled a <a href="https://54.87.153.110/raspberry-shake-personal-seismometer/">Raspberry Shake, a personal seismometer</a>.
- Built an <a href="https://twitter.com/JustinGosses/status/793264892652380160">internet connected pumpkin</a> for Halloween that talked to small children.
- Presented a <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Houston-Data-Visualization-Meetup/events/233893631/">talk on the changing data visualization landscape in large organizations (1974-2016)</a>.
- Competed in a <a href="https://twitter.com/JustinGosses/status/827585546247618560">machine-learning contest to predict well log facies</a> put on by a geophysics journal.
- Created an <a href="https://justingosses.github.io/AR_BusinessCard/">augmented reality webpage / business card</a> using AR.js, which leverages three.js, aframe.js, and ARtoolkit.
- Used <a href="https://github.com/yuriyi/hackathon2017/blob/master/README.md">SVM machine-learning approach to identify direct returns, reflections, multiples, and coherent noise in seismic gathers as part of a Geoscience Hackathon</a> organized by Agile Scientific and Total. I participated virtually and the rest of my team was physically present in Paris.
- <a href="https://sketchcity.org/category/harvey/">Helped build map applications to assist in the spreading and collection of accurate information about shelters and flooding post-Hurricane Harvey</a> in collaboration with a large number of other volunteers via <a href="http://sketchcity.org/">SketchCity</a>, a civic tech organization.
- Built version zero of an <a href="https://github.com/JustinGOSSES/SurViz_dcjs_googleform">application that can take in any google forms results csv files, pick the right charts, and create a data visualization</a> such that clicking on an answer to a question filters the answers to every other question.
- Participating in a <a href="https://agilescientific.com/events/2017/9/22/geophysics-hackathon">geoscience hackathon</a> run by AgileScientific before the annual Society of Exploration Geophysicists Conference in Houston. Built a python-based machine-learning model to mimic geologists’ stratigraphic picks of the top of the McMurry Formation in Canada. Still working on this project as I get spare cycles.
- Building a “where science happens in Houston” map that leverages web-scraping and machine-learning.
- Played around with using three.js to make three-dimensional <a href="https://justingosses.github.io/lidar_threejs_playground/">data visualizations from car-based lidar data</a>.
- Did a quick bit of machine-learning in a jupyter notebook to <a href="https://github.com/JustinGOSSES/WhichJobTitle">answer the question, “software engineer or data scientist”?</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/JustinGOSSES/wellio.js">Built a well log file uploader & parser called “wellio.js”</a> that converts LAS files into JSON files, so the data can be manipulated by JavaScript. This enables other applications to be built that load local LAS files and manipulate/visualize them in the browser without needing python, server, or a proprietary application.
- <a href="https://beta.observablehq.com/@justingosses/">Wrote a bunch of small JavaScript data visualization experiments on ObservableHQ</a>, which is a new way to write public, live, forkable JavaScript in a way that feels a lot like a more easily sharable Jupyter notebook Specifically, messing around with machine-learning, data parsing, and sonification of data in JavaScript, often with geology or NASA data.
- Presented work on using machine learning to predict well log tops at the annual AAPG conference in San Antonio in May of 2019. You can find the <a href="https://justingosses.github.io/predictatops/html/index.html">Predictatops project on github with links to the presentation</a>.
- Participated in the 2 day <a href="https://glasstire.com/">Glasstire</a> Datahack. Glasstire is an art website with 18 years of art event data in the city of Houston. I combined the art dataset with an older half-cleaned dataset of locations for companies advertising science jobs in Houston to create <a href="https://justingosses.github.io/glasstiredatahack/kepler/index.html">a visualization of the distribution of Art and Science in the city of Houston</a>. I leveraged a random forest model to clean the science data. <a href="https://github.com/JustinGOSSES/glasstiredatahack">Datahack code repository</a>. Old <a href="https://github.com/JustinGOSSES/HoustonScienceCity">science city repository</a>. <a href="https://justingosses.github.io/glasstiredatahack/kepler/index.html">Hackathon product</a>.
- Playing around in ObservableHQ.com with the notion of an <a href="https://observablehq.com/@justingosses/overly-simplified-stratigraphic-modeling">explorable explainable for basic stratigraphy concepts</a> related to sea-level and shoreface depositional environments.
- <a href="https://github.com/JustinGOSSES/wellioviz">Building Wellioviz.js a javascript library for building well log visualizations on the web</a>. While wellio.js focuses on converting LAS 2.0 well logs to JSON, there wasn’t really anything, at least open-source, to visualize well logs in modern JavaScript. G3.js existed but was no longer being developed. Plus, it relies on the older d3.js version 3.  Hoping to eventually build a web UI so users can load well logs and change their visualization without any code knowledge or use of a paid product. Wellioviz.js takes in all plotting data and style instructions via a JSON so it should be possible to eventually connect it to Python code as well.
- Participated in <a href='https://softwareunderground.org/blog'>Transform2020</a>, an online week long meeting put together by SWUNG (Software Underground).  Transform2020 was a great example of what is possible when you design an event with a digital first perspective as opposed to replicating an in-person meeting via teleconference. Transform had hackathons/sprints, unsessions , tutorials, and lightning talks. I participated in the hackathon by leading a sprint around wellioviz, and I also gave <a href="https://observablehq.com/@justingosses/draft-shifting-from-scientific-python-to-a-javascript-mind">this 5 minute lightning talk about advice I give Pythonistas starting off in JavaScript</a>. The slides were, of course, built with JavaScript.
- Created repository <a href="https://github.com/JustinGOSSES/geoVec-playground">“geoVec-playground” that takes a glove model trained on thousands of geoscience papers (with focus on soils) and represents the words in a 3D embedding space</a> using google’s stand alone embedding projector as a way to explore the model and gain a better understanding of its performance. Also, just interested in how to convert pre-trained glove models to tensorflow word2vec style format, so I can reuse some tools across different word embeddings.
- Wrote medium blog post <a href="https://justingosses.medium.com/alternatives-to-iris-finding-drop-in-replacements-for-overused-example-datasets-ecea03b4ad00">“Alternatives to Iris: Finding Drop-in Replacements for Overused Example Datasets”</a> as part of a thought experiment part of the way towards the goal I really want to get to, which is programmatically finding datasets that could be used for specific workflows / end projects based on characteristics of the known datasets used in those workflows.
- Finally got around to try some generative art code via some quick notebooks on Observable <a href="https://observablehq.com/@justingosses/messing-around-with-a-fork-2342">here</a> and <a href="https://observablehq.com/@justingosses/svg-rectangles">here</a>. Pleasantly surprised how easy it was after the first little learning hump, so will try more of this in future.
- Whenever I try to get on the water be it surfing, paddle boarding, fishing, or sailing in the ocean, bay, lake, or river I check a variety of different sources of information. There’s a folder on my phone with  10 different pages. Brainstorming what I could do to <a href="https://github.com/JustinGOSSES/sideproject_planning/blob/master/water_activities_dashboard_houston.md">combine</a> some of those into one page via iframes or data visualizations. The first draft is a single GitHubPages page in a repo called <a href="https://github.com/JustinGOSSES/water-check-houston">water-check-houston</a>.
- Doing a bit of research into application of deep learning and image recognition to generating data products that describe wave properties and surfers.

### Side-Projects over the last couple months
- Was recognized as a <a href="https://observablehq.com/community">“Featured Creator”</a> on Observablehq.com, a website / tool for data visualization.
- Wrote <a href="https://justingosses.medium.com/beyond-awesome-lists-3ccb074f7859">this</a> Medium post about an in progress side project to create an easily forkable repository template that visualizes the de-facto community of related code & developers that is sometimes described by Awesome lists.
- Finally attempted to organize my side projects a bit with a <a href="https://github.com/JustinGOSSES/sideproject_planning/blob/master/README.md">README</a> that splits out what is active, stalled, or just in idea phase.
- Wrote a little draft Observable notebook that takes your location and uses text-to-speech web API and a geology API called Macrosoft to <a href="https://observablehq.com/@justingosses/stratigraphy-speech">tell you verbally about the geology of the rocks where you are</a>. This was prompted by a tweet by <a href="https://twitter.com/DynamicWebPaige">DynamicWebPaige</a> wanting an audio book about local geology she could use on a train and a previous Observable notebook by <a href="https://observablehq.com/@ananya-roy/stratigraphy-visualizer">Ananya Roy</a>. 
- Redoing my website. I've been using a WordPress based site for 6 year and trying to recreate it in Next.js & tailwind.css with deployment to Azure Static Web Apps.
