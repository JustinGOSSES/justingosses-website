# Contributing

<b>Yes, please Make a Contribution! I make mistakes a lot</b>

## Who Can Submit a Change or Fix

Anyone

Am I expecting lots of contributions? No, this is a repository that builds a personal website. It doesn't occur often, but it does occur. Once a typo accidentally spelled a curse word in a position it could have been read as intential. I was very appreciative of that issue.

## Reasons to Make a Contribution
- Justin spelled something wrong
- Something got messed up and something on the page doesn't work anymore
- A link doesn't work
- Something else should be said
- Other thing I'm not thinking about?
