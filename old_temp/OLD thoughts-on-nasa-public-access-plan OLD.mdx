## Introduction to NASA's proposed Public Access Plan

NASA recently released an request for information on their proposed 2023 
[Public Access Plan](https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/nasa_ocs_public_access_plan_may_2023.pdf).
This effort is part of NASA's ["Transform to Open Science (TOPS)"]("https://science.nasa.gov/open-science/transform-to-open-science") 
part of a year long push for open science across several US government agencies and the White House. 
As part of releasing the plan, they also requested a ["Request for Information"](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/05/18/2023-10643/request-for-information-nasa-public-access-plan-for-increasing-access-to-the-results-of), 
which is a standard way government agencies ask for feedback from the public. The comment period ends on 08/17/2023. 
The [request for information](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/05/18/2023-10643/request-for-information-nasa-public-access-plan-for-increasing-access-to-the-results-of)
document outlines several areas that they are particularly interested in feedback from the public.

<b>This blog post was written as an exercise in considering what feedback might be given in a request for information response.</b>

## Background on NASA on public access to publications, code, data, etc.

NASA has a long history of making its publications, data, and code available to the public. 
However, that task is never as easy as it sounds. To give a few examples: 
1. Scientists have an incentive to publish in high impact journals. Those journals often want to charge people to read them, which can reduce access to publicly funded research results, code, etc.
2. Certain types of data released can get quite large making it necessary to operate and in some cases invent systems to enable the public to access the data and work with it in ways that do not create unfortunate process burdens or costs that stiffle use.
3. NASA and its contractors both write code is extremely sensitive, for example code that is ued to control rockets, and less sensitive code that can be widely distributed. It is difficult to create processes that worth extremely well at both ends of the spectrum.  

The [Public Access Plan](https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/nasa_ocs_public_access_plan_may_2023.pdf)
is an attempt to improve from the current situation to something a little better. 

I advise you to go and read it as it won't be summarized here. However, it is worth pointing out that 
at the top of the document, it highlights give revisions from the 2014 plan. 

- There shall be no publication embargo period for peer-reviewed publications (a 12 month embargo had been allowed)
- Data that support peer-reviewed publications shall be made available in a public archive at the time of publication
- Software should be included as part of Open Access, subject to NASA software release requirements
- Software used to generate research findings/results should be made available in a public archive at the time of publication
- Other data products beyond peer-reviewed publications and software should be considered as part of Open Access

These headlines changes represent a step forward and are in direct response to real frustrations 
with data and code in NASA-funded studies not always being available... or available without significant 
friction that limited their reuse and impact. 

## Personal experiences with public access at NASA

I previously worked as a contractor within NASA's Office of Chief Information Officer in what has been reorganized into 
[Information, Data, and Analytics Services (IDAS)]("https://www.nasa.gov/offices/ocio/operations") and among
other things helped to run [data.nasa.gov]("https://data.nasa.gov"), [code.nasa.gov]("https://code.nasa.gov"), 
and the [NASA GitHub organization]("https://github.com/nasa"). These experiences gave me insight into the 
challenges of releasing data, releasing code, and working in the open in the NASA context that inform my 
thoughts shared here.

{/* #### Why care about making NASA data and code public
The public access plan document directly addresses this question, but here are a few highlights in my own words.

1. If you're a US citizen, you already paid for it. You shouldn't have to pay again.
2. Studies that are not reproducible have much less value. Without easy access to all the code and data, it is often impossible to reproduce studies. Unfortunately, science is filled with stories of flashy studies that an entire field followed only to later released they couldn't be reproduced.
3. For others to build upon existing work and make new discovering, code and data needs to be open. */}

#### NASA is made of many sub-organizations with different missions, this effort is driven by one subset of the larger NASA

It is worth pointing out that NASA is an agency made up of several sub-organizations. 
Each of these sub-organizations has different cultures, missions, and things they are better or worse at. 
These differences are more pronounced at NASA than I have experienced with BP or Microsoft.

This public access plan is driven by the Science Mission Directorate. Compared to other parts of NASA, 
they fund academic research a lot more, work with outside partners a lot more, and much less often 
work with sensitive data or code that needs to be tightly controlled.

NASA policy and regulations are written into NASA Procedural Requirements (NPRs) 
or NASA Policy Directives (NPDs). You can read them all online at the 
[NODIS Library](https://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov/main_lib.cfm), which you can think of of a 
gigantic file cabinet filled with rules written a little bit at a time over decades and decades.
If you read the Public Access Plan closely, you'll see NPRs and NPDs mentioned in the sense that 
it acknowledges their existence and says they still apply but positions the Public Access Plan as 
additional and specific to research software. This fuzzily phrased statement is necessary 
as they are trying to create public access policies that do not require changing large amounts 
of existing NPRs and NPDs or require buy-in from every sub-organization within NASA. 
Other sub-organizations have more sensitive code or data more often, 
so they might want other policies as they have different needs.
Other sub-organizations are less motivated by public release.
Additionally, NPRs and NPDs are typically changed in small bits every several years, 
so anything that requires large rewrites to many existing NPRs or NPDs 
becomes a very heavy boulder to roll up the hill.


## Software Sharing and Archiving

This blog post will focus on the fifth question in NASA's 
[Request for Information](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/05/18/2023-10643/request-for-information-nasa-public-access-plan-for-increasing-access-to-the-results-of) 
for feedback on the NASA Public Access Plan. 

The question in full is:

-----------------
<i>
5.  Suggestions on sharing and archiving of software. Sites like GitHub and Zenodo offer ways to distribute and manage software. NASA is seeking suggestions on improving the archiving, sharing, and maintenance of software for reuse.
</i>

### The importance to talk about different types of software with different goals and characteristics

A mistake that I see a lot, which also I think exists in this document, is it talks about code as a general thing
but clearly they have particular type of repository in mind made by specific types of people for specific reasons. 
There are a few potential types of harms is this "median" repository approach. First, you'll probably making policies
that apply to repositories that are pretty far from that median. Second, each person's assumption of that median is 
influenced by their own experience and the type of code they work with the most. You quickly get to a point of talking 
past one another. Third, your assumptions regarding what's hard to force on developers or useful to support tend to 
rapidly focus on that median type of repository leading to blind spots. 

In this document, there are hints that their implied median repository is code whose production was funded by a grant,
tied to a scientific publication, released to the pubic at the same time their publication was published, and 
immediately archived as a static asset, probably only useful to people who read the coupled publication.

<b> That median repository is not a great description for all NASA science related code</b>

The most impactful scientific code often has whole communities that build up around it. Scientific code might be 
developed in the open far in advance of a paper being published. Useful code might not even be specific to a 
single publication but weakly related to many publications or no publications at all. The code that ends up 
being reused is ideally not archival or what existed at time of publication but a repository that is alive and 
continually maintained and expanded by the community of people who find value in it. 

<b> These variations in code characteristics need to be better reflected in the Public Access Plan!</b>

### The Public Access Plan needs a broader description of scientific code

Instead of: 

_Words from Public Access Plan: page 19_
```
SMPs must provide a plan for making scientific software that underlie the results and
findings in peer-reviewed publications digitally accessible at the time of publication. 
```
Include the possibility that the code is developed in the open before publication:
```_Words from Public Access Plan: page 19_
SMPs must provide a plan for making scientific software that underlie the results and
findings in peer-reviewed publications digitally accessible at the time of publication or before. 
```

Instead of: 

_Words from Public Access Plan: page 20_
```
This [code release] requirement could be met by
including the software as supplementary information to the published article, or
through other means. The published article should indicate how the software
can be accessed.
```

Explicitly close the "upon request" loop hole that has been shown to be worth very
little in practical terms as few people respond to requests for code. Encourage 
use of public facing repositories where people can read the code before downloading it.
People do not like downloading large files they can not say for certain is in them, so 
putting it on a public facing GitHub or GitLab repository increases chance of evaluation, 
critique, and reuse. Also, this opens up the possibility that people can discover related
publications through the code, not always publication then code. Opening up better 
discovery pathways in both directions increases chances of discovery, reuse, and replication.
```
This [code release] requirement could be met by
including the software as supplementary information to the published article, or
through other means. The published article should indicate how the software
can be accessed. An "upon request" statement is not acceptable unless the code can not be released publicly.
Ideally, the code will accessible via a public repository.
``` 

### Archiving and maintaining software are different things

Under the "Changes to the NASA software policy" section, it talks about adding 
requirements for all research proposers to submit Software Management Plans (SMPs) 
that describe how the proposed research plan confirms to NASA policy on dissemination and 
sharing of results.

_One of the policies for Software Management Plans states on page 19_
```
Plans for archiving and preserving of the software, as appropriate (use of
existing databases or public repositories will be strongly encouraged),
including how long the software will be preserved or maintained
```

This is awkward language as preserving and maintaining are very different things.
Archiving or preserving software is creating a fixed
version of it that does not change. If your paper was creating with code that 
has a bug in it. That bug should absolutely stay in the archived version.
In contrast, maintaining code implies the code is changing. You are fixing 
bugs, patching security holes, adding documentation to onboard new users, etc. 

While archiving code only requires that the code exist somewhere likely to persist. 
Maintaining the code, especially if some of the bugs are to be identified 
by users who are not the originators, requires the existence of the code on a version 
control platform, ideally one that is publicly accessible and enables people to 
read the code without needing permissions from the authors. While, I am not sure 
NASA should mandate code be placed in a public facing GitHub or GitLab repository.
It certainly would be beneficial to everyone if it encouraged it.

These differences between archiving and maintaining are not expressed well in 
the document, which is a weakness that should be addressed. 

The line above could be modified slightly to say: 
```
Plans for archiving and preserving of the software, as appropriate (use of
existing databases or public repositories will be strongly encouraged),
including how long the software authors are committed to maintaining the software.
```
However, whether or not software will be maintained into the future is hard to 
predict. Often whether or not it gets maintained is dependent on use or other 
factors that are not known far in advance. Therefore, it might be reasonable, 
at least for new software to take out the maintenance statement entirely
and just say: 
```
Plans for archiving and preserving of the software, as appropriate (use of
existing databases or public repositories will be strongly encouraged).
```
However, fixed archives where code is zipped up into a single file
 are not at all suited for maintaining code, so an alternative statement to 
 ensure archival but also enable maintenance, discovery, community building, etc.: 
```
- Plans for archiving and preserving of the software, as appropriate (use of
existing databases or public repositories will be strongly encouraged).
- State whether the code will be placed on a publicly visible repository where it can be 
seen without download, issues can be left by users, and development if warranted can continue post initial publication.
```

It is perfectly acceptable that some code will never be touched again after a connected
article is published, either by the authors or anyone else. However, to make sure NASA 
gets the best value for its funding, it should set up expectations that allow for code 
to exist in places that maximize the potential for pseudo-random discovery by others, 
bug fixes, and potentially whole communities to form around it. 
There is potential for that to happen if the code is in a public GitHub or GitLab repository. 
It is almost certainly not going to happen if the code is zipped up into a single file on a 
data system for government code. They simply lack the features. 

#### Absolutely need to talk about public facing code repositories, not just archives
The current plan does not mention public repositories GitHub or GitLab once. 
This may be because they are products and the government generally does not like to 
mention specific products or companies in plans, regulations, etc. 
This is fine to a point, but those products are where code is written, stored, 
and accessed by groups of people not in the same physical place in 2023. 

<b>If NASA wants to ensure public access to its code, it needs to find a way to talk about 
public facing code repository mechanisms in use by most of the world. <b>


Compliance vs. incentives...

### Need to ensure Software Management Plans do not become waterfall development mandates

_Words from Public Access Plan: ???????
```
Appropriate mechanisms and metrics will be developed to ensure that funding
recipients are made aware of their obligations and to monitor whether awardees have
complied with their SMPs. Compliance will be verified by the program officer by
evaluation of required project reports and, if necessary, continuing funds may be
withheld in cases of noncompliance. 
```

This requirement is generally okay. However, I am a little worried that is interpreted 
strictly such that all software products mentioned in the SMP are expected to be 
delivered as end products. This might unintentional promote waterfall style 
code development where there is a strong push to predict the end product at the begging 
of th product. Software is often better developed in a more flexible and iterative manner 
in which early views of what will be delivered are thrown out as learning occurs during
development.

A possible shift in wording to more directly tie "compliance" to the program requirements 
instead of the the software management plan might lessen potential to push scientists into more of a 
waterfall style of development.
```

```

### DOIs, Metadata, and Discovery

{/* - Love the call out for more education needing on using DOIs for software
- Need for education around software citation and enabling community contribution
- How I recommend using Zenodo & GitHub combined
- citation in code (push for a standard)
- discovery using code search?
- how to connect
- Dependency vs. citation? <= What are metrics NASA can track there like papers?

- Needs
  - Discovery...where it happens...how it happens...
    - Why it is valuable (science tree falls in forest and no one hears it)
    - Archived state is not ideal for this. No run searches for something they don't know exists in one fo the many NASA archives.
  - Be able for both people and machines to jump across code, data, and papers
  - citations is an engine like it or not. 
     - Code needs citations. 
     - Can NASA encourage scientific code review papers?
- current status
- future opportunities:
  - education
  - better discovery  */}

{/* ## Education needed to grow cultural understanding and open source skills

Major areas:
- DOI
- Code citation
- Archive & pubic repository that can change
- 

``` page 20
Software released independently from the peer-reviewed manuscript must be assigned
a Unique Digital Object Identifier (DOI) to enable preservation, discovery, and citation of
the software. 
```
NO!!!!!! all code needs DOI! */}

### Measuring NASA related code
##### Identifying impact, communities, contributions, and demands on time
To do a good job at funding software and ensuring its access but the public, NASA needs a better 
understanding of what software gets built, what it depends on, why that software exists, 
why it contains to exist, and how it can be helpful and not hurtful. Gathering and analyzing 
this data is not a small task.

{/* - measuring type of code and how it is used
- Measuring impact of NASA funded code
- Contributions by NASA to non-NASA code */}

## conclusions

{/* words.......... */}

1. Explicitly talk about a fixed archival of code vs. live public repository
  1.A. Mention how GitHub/GitLab/etc. as that's how people actually work with software in 2023. Use a general term for them if you must.
  1.B. Zenodo or equivelant for archival. GitHub or equivelant for live repository. You can link them!
  1.B. Mandate archival. Recommend maintain, issues, community, etc. 
  1.C. If not maintaining code and accepting community contributions... SAY SO!
2. Educate on DOIs and citation to enable better connections, tracking, and discovery, and creation of value.
  2.A. DOI for all archival of code.
  2.B. Code citation file. (recommend they use a standard!)
  2.C. Figure out how to incentivize scientific code journals as a way to increase the value of scientific code for certain users.
  2.B. Encourage citation of code in non-code journals. It is common for papers that use code, not cite it or cite it in some many differenet ways that it is impossible to programmatically extract!!!















{/* ## Points to highlight

In this blog post, I will make respond to snippets of the public access plan with one of the four following manners.

1. This is great. 
2. Needs expanded.
3. Needs changed. 
4. New thing needs to be added. 

### Ignored needs of engineering data

{/* ### NASA software policies don't have a scientific software escape hatch so existing NPRs need addressed

[Thoughts: Words from Public Access Plan: page 18 ]
```
Technical software with no
inherent scientific utility is not included in the scope of this policy, but this software can be
released openly to ensure the widest distribution of NASA information to the extent allowed by
applicable law and existing NASA policies.
```

_Words from Public Access Plan: page 21_
```
 Current Documents/Policies/Websites
The revised research software policy will be added to NASA Procedural Requirement,
1080.1 A, Requirements for the Conduct of NASA Research and Technology (R&T). NASA
will also amend its NASA Grants Handbook, NASA Headquarters Science Mission
Directorate Management Handbook, and any other relevant documents or policies to
reflect the revised research software policy. 
```
[Thoughts: _New thing that needs to be added_ ] */}

{/* ##### Context
Left off this list are NPRs that everyone inside NASA has to follow!
Scientific software policy is to a large extent additive to existing software NPR policies, not an escape hatch.
Ignoring that has limits.

##### Proposed change
Words go here. Words go here. Words go here. Words go here.

##### reasoning
Words go here. Words go here. Words go here. Words go here. */}



{/* ### Call out to using community standards is excellent
_Words from Public Access Plan: page ??????????
```
Encourage the abundant use of community-based standards to ensure widest
possible application. NASA policy encourages all supported researchers to make
use of existing data and metadata standards (format and content standards), to
the extent feasible.
```
[Thoughts: _this is great_]

Give example of STAC....

Any teeth? Could there be an expectation for it to be in software management plan? */}

Require all researchers to share their scientific software developed to support a
scholarly publication at the time of publication. This includes the scientific
software that are displayed in charts and figures or needed to validate the

### Challenges for NASA open source discovery
_Words from Public Access Plan: page 21
```
NASA will list scientific software in appropriate NASA designated repositories. This can
include the NASA catalog of software, the Science Discovery Engine, and the
Astrophysics Data System. NASA will identify software to be curated as part of these
catalogs. The catalog of scientific software will begin at the time of implementation of
the policy. The public will have access to the catalog and associated data free of charge.
NASA will continue to identify additional approaches, involving public and private sector
entities, and will continue efforts to improve public access to research data.
```
||||_Needs expanded_||||

- most people don't go to these
- why both software.nasa.gov & code.nasa.gov exist
- The need for connections between publications, code, and data.
- Need to offers standardized citation of code in publications so findable at scale!


### Contributions by NASA to non-NASA code

_Words from Public Access Plan: page ????????_
```
NASA employees, contractors, and grantees are encouraged to contribute and
participate in open-source software projects that would further advance the scientific
goals of NASA. 
```
[Thoughts: _Needs expanded_]

...so what does this mean....in practice? Will there be a green light in a NPR or a process?

How does this translate into what managers ask their staff to spend their time on?




### Measuring impact of NASA funded code
[Thoughts:_New thing that needs to be added_]

What code creation and maintenance does NASA fund? There is a need to establish baselines to create strategy.

### Explicit direction to NASA program managers to be more specific in their announcements of resource opportunities 
_Words from Public Access Plan: ???????
```
Require that NASA program managers include in announcements of research
opportunities (1) specific software requirements and expectations; (2) an
example SMP or outline for the specific type of software likely to result from the
funded projects; or (3) a statement that SMP is not required because of the
nature of the activity (e.g., no software is expected, or proprietary software are
expected). 
```
[Thoughts: _Needs expanded_]

Great...but what can NASA do about increasing funding and job changes related to creating software over papers?


Compliance vs. incentives...

### Software plans change
_Words from Public Access Plan: ???????
```
Appropriate mechanisms and metrics will be developed to ensure that funding
recipients are made aware of their obligations and to monitor whether awardees have
complied with their SMPs. Compliance will be verified by the program officer by
evaluation of required project reports and, if necessary, continuing funds may be
withheld in cases of noncompliance. 
```

Need to ensure compliance doesn't require waterfall style development and all the problems associated with that!

Current policies appears to assume all software is NASA’s median software
The NASA Public Access plan is currently written in ways that appear to assume scientific software is (1) kept private until published together with a paper (2) tightly coupled with a paper (3) that exists in public mostly as a static artifact. This may be true for much of the software development that NASA funds, but there can be negative impacts from writing those assumptions into the policy as it biases NASA programs to only fund that type of code development and expect that type of software in proposals. The most impactful scientific code often has whole communities that build up around it much later than its original public release. Scientific code might be developed in the open far in advance of any paper being published. Useful code might not even be specific to a single publication but weakly related to many publications or no publications at all. The code that ends up being reused is ideally not archival or what existed at time of publication but a repository that is alive and continually maintained and expanded by the community of people who find value in it. NASA appears to be writing policy around public release of code that ignores some of the most impactful code for scientific communities. It should be considered how to write a policy that takes into consideration a wider range of software types, development histories, and funding scenarios.

As an example for how the language could be changed to assume the median scientific software project less often, consider that this line on page 18: 
Scientific software underlying peer-reviewed scholarly publications resulting from
federally-funded research must be made freely available and publicly accessible by
default at the time of publication
Could be changed to clarify that release of software at time of publication is the minimum and not the only option. 
Scientific software underlying peer-reviewed scholarly publications resulting from
federally-funded research must be made freely available and publicly accessible by
default by the time of publication if not prior.
